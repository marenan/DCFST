# DCFST
Learning Feature Embeddings for Discriminant Model based Tracking

Accepted by ECCV2018.

DCFST is a simple yet high-performance tracker. This project provides the training and test codes of DCFST. (I will gradually add parts of the code as soon as I have free time to deal with this project.)

Thanks for the handsome work, ATOM, by Martin Danelljan. This project is highly based on pytracking (https://github.com/visionml/pytracking). Particularly, it is based on the early version (pytorch 0.4.1) of pytracking (https://github.com/visionml/pytracking/tree/pytorch041). Therefore, if there are any missing documents and operation descriptions due to my carelessness, please refer to the corresponding section in pytracking.

DCFST achieves state-of-the art accuracy on six popular tracking benchmarks,
